							<h3>What is covered:</h3>
							<p>Buildings insurance covers the cost of damage to the structure of your property. This includes the roof, walls, ceilings, floors, doors and windows. Outdoor structures such as garages and fences are also included.  Buildings insurance covers permanent fixtures and fittings, interior decoration and underground tanks, pipes, cables, and drains for which you are responsible from your home to the mains supply.</p>
							<p>Your buildings insurance should cover the full rebuild cost the property. This should include costs such as demolition, clearing the site, and architect's fees. Make sure any special features such as a luxury fitted kitchen or a conservatory are also included.</p>
							<h3>Accidental damage:</h3>
							<p>You can extend a buildings insurance policy to include accidental damage to the inside of your home. This costs extra but is well worth having, as most smaller claims tend to be accidents. (eg Putting foot through loft floor). </p>
							<h3>Contents insurance:</h3>
							<p>As well as the property itself, you need to protect the valuable contents inside your home. This covers the value of your possessions in the event of flood damage, theft or accidental damage (if included in the cover you have chosen).</p>
							<h3>Peace of Mind:</h3>
							<p>You could go to one of the supermarket insurance sites, maybe get it a few pennies cheaper and cross your fingers in the hope that you don't have to make a claim.</p>
							<p>Or you could get a quote from our panel of leading insurers who are well trusted in the industry to look after Household Insurance if the need arrives to make a claim.</p>
