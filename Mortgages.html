							<h3>Let us help you find the best mortgage deal</h3>
							<p>Are you a first time buyer looking to get your foot on the property ladder? Or are you a seasoned homeowner looking to move up to the next rung?  Whether you're self employed, just starting a new job, a buy-to-let investor, receiving a gifted deposit from a relative, or looking to arrange an ex-pat mortgage, we can advise and secure the mortgage you need – regardless of how difficult it might seem.</p>
							<p>Securing the right mortgage independently can often be a minefield. So, in an already complicated world, why make things even more difficult?  We offer specialist, bespoke and individual advice to all of our clients to help ensure you get the most competitive and suitable deal based on your circumstances.</p>
							<p>There is no charge for an initial consultation, so you have nothing to lose by contacting us for a quote.</p>
							<p>Once you are happy to proceed, we will take care of the complicated paperwork and liaise with the lender and any third parties (i.e. estate agents, surveyors, and solicitors) giving you peace of mind, safe in the knowledge that Evergreen is working on your behalf.</p>
							<h3> Welcome first time buyers</h3>
							<p>Evergreen are committed to securing your approved mortgage as simply and stress-free as possible.
							Of course, you could spend hours trawling the high street and the internet, you could even talk to the banks one-by-one through their call centres and find out how much they can each lend you and what products they can offer…or you could let us do it all for you.</p>
							<p>We’ll take the time to sit down with you, discuss your priorities and understand your preferences.  We’ll then scour the market to find you the best deal, and once you give us the go ahead we’ll secure an Agreement In Principle (AIP) for you and we won’t charge a penny to get you this far.</p>
							<p>Then once you’ve found a property we’ll help you from start to finish, liaising with estate agents, solicitors, and surveyors where required.</p>
							<h3>Remortgaging to raise capital or release some equity</h3>
							<p>If you’re coming to the end of your current mortgage scheme, or paying your lender’s Standard Variable Rate (SVR) then the chances are we could save you money.</p>
							<p>You may be concerned about interest rates, hoping to reduce your monthly outgoings, or considering releasing equity from your property for home improvements, a new venture, or to help a family member take their first step onto the property ladder.  Whatever your reason, we can offer you honest, impartial advice and search the market to find you the best mortgage products.</p>
							<p>Even if it’s just been a while since you’ve reviewed your mortgage, we’d be happy to offer you a comprehensive review and let you know if there are any mortgages out there worth switching to – it could be worth £’000s to you annually.</p>
							<h3>Buy to Let or Let to Buy?</h3>
							<p>Looking to create a reliable pension where you’re in control?  We can help you take your first step into the buy to let market.</p>
							<p>Have you considered upsizing to your new home and renting out your existing property?</p>
							<p>Or are you an experienced landlord looking to refinance your portfolio in order to make your next purchase?</p>
							<p>We have access to providers who can lend where renovation is required or even if the property isn’t currently habitable.</p>
							<h3>Homemovers</h3>
							<p>Never Again! We’ve probably all said that after unloading the last box of ‘stuff’ into a new home but chances are we’ll be doing it all over again in a few years time.</p>
							<p>We can’t help you get that once flat-pack wardrobe down the stairs, but we can help you find the perfect fit mortgage for your new pad, or even move (or “port”) your existing mortgage if the terms are favourable.</p>
							<p>From sitting down to work out the costs of moving, to calculating how much you can borrow and what the repayments would be, we can make sure you’ve got your mortgage sorted before you’ve even found a property.</p>
							<p>We’ll search the market to find you the best mortgage deals, and give you honest, impartial advice to get you moving quickly and as stress-free as possible.</p>
